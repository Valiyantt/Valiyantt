# ⚙️ Let’s Get Real. Let’s Build.

Hi! I’m **Franz Alverio**, a **Backend Developer** — currently merging creativity and computation to design intelligent systems that make sense in the real world.

🎓 **BS Computer Science** @ Saint Michael’s College of Laguna  
💡 **Thesis:** *A Multi-Modal Predictive Framework for Sentiment Analysis*  
*(Integrating BERT, VGG16, and Wav2Vec2 architectures with late fusion aggregation and Docker deployment)*

## 🧠 Background & Focus

I’m driven by systems that work — not just in theory, but in production.
My foundation in finance, customer service, and advertising trained me to understand people; my background in computer science and information technology taught me to understand logic.
Now, I’m fusing both perspectives to engineer backends and intelligent systems that are robust, maintainable, and meaningful.

I specialize in Backend Engineering, Data-Driven AI, and Quality Assurance, with a project management mindset that ensures every build aligns with real-world usability and scalability.

**Core Focus Areas**:
- ⚙️ Backend Development – API design, distributed workflows, system optimization
- 🧮 SQL & Database Management – efficient schema design, query optimization, data integrity
- 🤖 AI & Machine Learning – sentiment analysis, multimodal models, and intelligent automation
- 🧪 Quality Assurance & Testing – unit/integration testing, error tracing, CI/CD integration
- 🧭 Project Management – agile workflows, technical documentation, and delivery discipline

My philosophy: Strong systems aren’t just coded — they’re architected.

## 💬 About Me

When I’m not training models or writing scripts, I’m probably:  
📸 Writing or designing something that hits emotionally  
🧭 Studying human patterns — online, political, or behavioral  
🔥 Building projects that challenge what’s “standard”
